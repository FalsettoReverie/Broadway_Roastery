            <p>Hi, I'm Simon a Web designer for the Broadway Roastery. You might be wondering how I ended up at this job. Well you see
            a long time ago I drank my first cup of coffee in the early hours of the morning. It tasted like burnt charcoal and I vowed
            to never drink a cup of coffee every again. But as time went one my appreciation for a good cup of joe has lead me to pursue
            in a career that favors both spectrums of what I love to do (Drink coffee and write some great code!) I designed this site to give
            everyone a chance to fully enjoy a great cup of coffee</p>
        </div>

            <img src="img/coffee2.jpg" height="50%" width="50%"/>
            <p>Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee plant is a bush or
                tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally
                grew in Africa, and now also grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia. They are an important
                crop for the economies of many countries. The first branded coffee to be sold commercially to the public was
                Nes Caf√© in 1879 The drink is made from the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually
                served hot, and is a popular drink in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug
                that keeps people awake.</p>

            <p>We are a group of computer science students at sask polytech who decided that it was a great idea to recreate the <bold>entire</bold> website from scratch. Despite the
            fact that we are still students I think that it's safe to say that we did a pretty great job in creating this website. (Also If you don't like coffee, the door is to the left
                . You can kindly exit the premises)</p>

            <h3>Come on down!</h3>
            <p> If your looking for a great time, come on down to the Broadway Roastery... on broadway avenue (Get it... the name is based on the street that we currently reside)</p>

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>We've got a great of selection of coffee from across the world. We also offer other beverages besides coffee for those
