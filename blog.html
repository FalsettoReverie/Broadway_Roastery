            <p>Hi, I'm Simon a Web designer for the Broadway Roastery. You might be wondering how I ended up at this job. Well you see
            a long time ago I drank my first cup of coffee in the early hours of the morning. It tasted like burnt charcoal and I vowed
            to never drink a cup of coffee every again. But as time went one my appreciation for a good cup of joe has lead me to pursue
            in a career that favors both spectrums of what I love to do (Drink coffee and write some great code!) I designed this site to give
            everyone a chance to fully enjoy a great cup of coffee</p>

            <div class="image1" style="height: 100px;">Image</div>
            <p>We are a group of computer science students at sask polytech who decided that it was a great idea to recreate the <bold>entire</bold> website from scratch. Despite the
            fact that we are still students I think that it's safe to say that we did a pretty great job in creating this website. (Also If you don't like coffee, the door is to the left
                . You can kindly exit the premises)</p>

            <p> If your looking for a great time, come on down to the Broadway Roastery... on broadway avenue (Get it... the name is based on the street that we currently reside)</p>
